# Development of a React component library

This project is an initial experimentation on how to create a library of React components that can be published and used in other React applications

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

## Running the app

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm i`
### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
